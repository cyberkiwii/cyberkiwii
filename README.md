Hi, I'm Gracie Gallegos
I am a recent high school graduate and a Computer Science professional entering the work force.

During high school I studied Networking and Cyber Security at The East Valley Institute of Technology, a trade school in Arizona. I also took some Computer Programming classes in high school and discovered a passion for programming.

I also enjoy doing programming projects and work with languages such as Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Some things in tech that I am drawn to and would like to explore further are CTFs, Decryption, Computer Programming, Problem solving / debugging, and reverse engineering.
